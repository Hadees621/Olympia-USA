                Olympia Publishers India collaborates with leading non-profit
                organizations to spread the joy of reading, support learning and
                bring smiles to children through book donations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We regularly donate books to schools, take part in sponsored
                charity days such as World Water day or Mental Health Awareness
                week, where we aim to use the book’s positive message to inspire
                people and aid personal development. Our books travel beyond
                India to help uplift other communities such as donating books to
                reading charities that help children in Africa in local schools,
                libraries and hospitals. We help them to see the world from many
                different perspectives. You can keep track of the charities we
                donate to and work with by following us on our social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, we also take regular initiatives to help foster
                the creative potential of our publishing teams. We encourage
                regular breaks throughout the workday, walks around the area to
                stretch the legs and keep the eyes away from a computer screen
                for long length of time. We aim to create a relaxing, stress
                free environment where creativity can flow, and we do believe we
                are achieving this very well. We want Olympia Publishers to be a
                great place to be published and to work!

                Through books we are shaping future readers and representing the
                society that we live in. From our authors and illustrators to
                our publishing teams, we want to ensure the creators of our
                books truly represent the diversity in gender, age, sexuality
                and ethnicity and each member has their story which makes the
                Olympia family even more united and beautiful.

                Equality and diversity are at the core of our culture, and this

                  All of the paper that we use to make books is sustainably
                  sourced and is Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified.
                  The FSC is one of the only wood certification schemes endorsed
                  by green charities such as Greenpeace and the WWF. They also
                  support biodiversity, safe guarding forests and local
                  communities. As they say, “Forests for all, forever”. Our
                  books are also printed with Carbon Captured Paper. Carbon
                  Capture is a mechanism for offsetting the carbon produced in
                  the production and distribution of paper through the purchase
                  of 'credits'. These then translate into money which is given
                  to the Woodland Trust, who use it to plant trees which absorb
                  carbon from the atmosphere.

                  We encourage writers submitting their work to send it via
                  email or using our online submission form rather than sending
                  a printed manuscript by post. We try to revise and read proofs
                  electronically when-ever possible, and in general communicate
                  by phone and email rather than sending physical letters. These
                  small changes in our day-to-day lives do add up and help us to
                  become a forward thinking, independent publishing house. Every
                  day we learn something new; there is certainly room for
                  improvement and we continue our efforts to ensure we reduce
                  our environmental impact by making improvements through our
                  entire supply chain and working with suppliers who are taking
                  measures to manage their environmental impact.

                  ideas are rewarded. Every year we work as hard as we can to
