            Rudi Michael Jennings spent the majority of his childhood growing up
            in the Norfolk countryside of fields and trees, really living
            amongst nature and possibly giving the basis of description in his
            book. Through travel, various professions and a keen interest in
            psychology and fantasy writings, he developed a style of his very
            own and is keen to share it with the fantasy adventure world. This
            plans to be the first instalment and adventure of many to come.
