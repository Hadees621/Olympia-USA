As we receive hundreds of submissions each month, we cannot guarantee which titles will be selected for publication.

    "para3": "Should we be unable to offer a traditional contract, but we feel the work has potential, an alternative offer may be made. This offer is known as a ‘partnership contract’ and is based on a contribution, to be paid by the author, to cover the initial production and printing cost of the book. For more information on the hybrid business model, please read this informative article."
